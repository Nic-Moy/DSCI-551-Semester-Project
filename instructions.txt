DSCI 551 Semester Project

Hi there! To run my semester Project, make sure all 6 attatched files are in the same directory. Then go to that directory in terminal.
The only dependency needed is streamlit so you'll have to run command:

pip install streamlit

Then once that is done you can run my app with command:

streamlit run StreamlitApp.py


Thank you!
